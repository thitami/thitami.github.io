          <p> I am a highly motivated <strong> Software Engineer </strong> with several years experience and a strong <strong> Computer Science </strong> background. I enjoy delivering <strong> effective and robust solutions</strong>.

              Passionate about following the most up-to-date Object Oriented development practices and building highly scalable, maintainable and secure systems. I have worked for several years for UK and German-based companies gaining significant experience in the start up world. Having participated in the full development cycle in <strong> Agile </strong> environments, I have worked in <strong> large scale systems </strong>, that have been optimized to handle hundreds of thousands of requests per second, serving the end user in great speed. Moreover, I strive to engage myself in <strong> software architecture </strong> decisions and take advantage of <strong> Unit Testing </strong>.</p>
